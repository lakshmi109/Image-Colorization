In digital image processing, colorization refers to the process of adding color to monochrome images or altering the existing colors in color images. Manual recolorization is a time-consuming task, requiring significant expertise and effort. Automatic recolorization aims to alleviate this burden by developing algorithms that can intelligently predict and apply color transformations to images.
In this project, we have explored a variety of techniques, leveraging both Deep Learning and traditional Computer Vision (CV) approaches, to achieve efficient and effective automatic recolorization of images.
